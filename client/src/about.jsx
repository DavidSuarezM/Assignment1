                        <p><strong>Name:</strong> David Andres Suarez Molina</p>
                        <p>I'm an international student from Ecuador, currently living in Toronto, Canada. I love coding, learning new programming languages, and everything related to technology. I also love the world of networks, which is why I studied Electronic Engineering with a focus on Telecommunications at the Salesian University of Ecuador. In Ecuador, I worked in the telecommunications field, installing structured cabling and laying GPON networks. I also taught networks and telecommunications, as a Cisco instructor.</p>
